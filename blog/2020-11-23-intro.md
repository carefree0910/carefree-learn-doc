`carefree-learn` is a minimal Automatic Machine Learning (AutoML) solution for tabular datasets based on PyTorch. It is the 2nd-place winner in the Global PyTorch Summer Hackathon 2020. The library is [documented](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs) and you can try it out after [installing it](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/getting-started/installation).

## Why carefree-learn?

If you are familiar with machine learning, you may already heard about scikit-learn and some other automl frameworks. The motivation behind creating carefree-learn was two fold:
+ Leverage [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) in the field of machine learning.
+ Provide a truly CAREFREE experience for both users and developers.

By saying carefree we mean that both using and developing carefree-learn could be finished in one line of code:

```python
import cflearn

# train a neural network on x & y
m = cflearn.make().fit(x, y)

# defining your new model and train with it
cflearn.register_model("awesome_model", pipes=[cflearn.PipeInfo("dndf")])
m = cflearn.make("awesome_model").fit(x, y)
```

:::note
Please refer to [Quick Start](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/getting-started/quick-start) and [Build Your Own Models](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/developer-guides/customization) for more details.
:::

You may argue that other libraries, like scikit-learn, also support building models in one line of code. But think about the messy stuffs (such as reading data from files, exploring data, performing data pre-processing, etc.) we need to do before we actually use these libraries, and contributing algorithms to these libraries is often much harder than writing your own ones. In carefree-learn, we've tried hard to ease these two procedures for you.

### Carefree using

As mentioned, other libraries (e.g. scikit-learn) can often only support `numpy` arrays or `DataFrame` as input, and have pretty much constraints (e.g. cannot contain `nan` values). In carefree-learn, however, we've tried hard to help you deal with almost **ANY** kind of tabular datasets, no matter how dirty and messy it is. This means carefree-learn actually provides an end-to-end pipeline on tabular datasets, including **AUTOMATICALLY** deal with:
+ Detection of redundant feature columns which can be excluded (all SAME, all DIFFERENT, etc).
+ Detection of feature columns types (whether a feature column is string column / numerical column / categorical column).
+ Encoding of string columns and categorical columns (Embedding or One Hot Encoding).
+ Pre-processing of numerical columns (Normalize, Min Max, etc.).
+ Imputation of missing values.
+ And much more…

Therefore, carefree-learn is possible to procss files directly (file-in, file-out):

```python
import cflearn

# train a neural network on train.csv
m = cflearn.make().fit("train.csv")
# make predictions on test.csv
predictions = m.predict("test.csv")
```

### Carefree developing

Thanks to the great modularization provided by [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), `carefree-learn` was able to design its (tabular datasets oriented) pipeline in a user-friendly as well as a developer-friendly way.

The basic component in `carefree-learn` is called a [`pipe`](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/design-principles#pipe), which corresponds to one of those *branches* which takes in all / part of the inputs, apply some [`transform`](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/design-principles#transform), extract some features with [`extractor`](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/design-principles#extractor), and then feed the final network ([`head`](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/design-principles#head)) with these features. Here's an example:

![Pipe](../static/img/pipe.png)

Since most of the deep learning models (neural networks) used in tabular datasets could be represented with `pipe`, developers can therefore focus on implementing one of its components (namely `extractor` and `head`), instead of having to care about the whole pipeline.

We've provided a detailed documention on [how to build your own models](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/developer-guides/customization), as well as an interesting [example](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/examples/operations) to guide you step by step. Please feel free to check them out and enjoy yourself!


## Why PyTorch?

The reason why I choosed [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) has already been mentioned above - it is perfectly modularized and customizable. Another reason is that although deep learning outshines in CV and NLP fields, it is not as popular when it comes to the tabular datasets. We think the main reason is that tabular datasets require so many messy steps before we could actually jump into the algorithm part, and there has not existed a modularized framework to organize these stuffs. That's why we tried our best to handle all of these for you and hope that it could help you focus on developing the core algorithms. And among the deep learning frameworks, [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) was truly the most elegant one and we were deeply attracted by its simplicity and power. Since there lacks a satisfying 'carefree' solution for tabular datasets,  we decided to take advantage of our knowledges and build one ourselves. So here comes the carefree-learn, which aims to provide out of the box tools to train and develop neural networks on tabular datasets with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).


## Getting Started

We've provided an [Installation Guide](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/getting-started/installation) as well as some real life [Examples](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/examples/iris) to walk you through the basic / advanced usages of carefree-learn. We've also provided a [Production Guide](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/user-guides/production) to show how could we pack the whole pipeline in carefree-learn efficiently into a zip file.


## AutoML on Iris

In this section, we would like to illustrate how to perform AutoML on the famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) in carefree-learn, as well as how to pack the AutoML results into production.

First, we need to prepare our datasets (with the help of [carefree-data](https://github.com/carefree0910/carefree-data)):

```python
from cfdata.tabular import *

# prepare iris dataset
iris = TabularDataset.iris()
iris = TabularData.from_dataset(iris)
# split 10% of the data as validation data
split = iris.split(0.1)
train, valid = split.remained, split.split
x_tr, y_tr = train.processed.xy
x_cv, y_cv = valid.processed.xy
data = x_tr, y_tr, x_cv, y_cv
```

Since carefree-learn has provided the `cflearn.Auto` API for out-of-the-box usages, AutoML in carefree-learn could be achieved in two lines of code:

```python
import cflearn

auto = cflearn.Auto("clf", models="fcnn")
auto.fit(*data, num_jobs=0)
```

We can make predictions directly with `auto.predict`:

```python
predictions = auto.predict(x_cv)
print("accuracy:", (y_cv == predictions).mean())
```

If we are satisfied with the results, we can pack the models up into a zip file

```python
auto.pack("pack")
```

which could be used on our production environments / machines easily:

```python
import cflearn

unpacked = cflearn.Auto.unpack("pack")
predictions = unpacked.pattern.predict(x)
```

## Conclusions

Contained in this article is just a subset of the features that carefree-learn offers. Additional capabilities include [Distributed Training](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/user-guides/distributed#distributed-training), onnx export for [Production](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/user-guides/production), and more.

To learn more about carefree-learn, check out the [Examples](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/examples/iris) with jupyter notebooks included, as well as the [Developer's Guide](https://carefree0910.me/carefree-learn-doc/docs/developer-guides/customization) to see how do we customize models with carefree-learn. We sincerely hope that carefree-learn could help you either deal with tabular datasets easier or develop new algorithms on tabular datasets easier, and any contributions to carefre-learn would truly be welcomed.
